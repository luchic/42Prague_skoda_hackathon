## 🚀 How to Submit Your Solution

We use the standard GitHub **Fork & Pull Request** workflow. This is the only way to submit your project. Follow these steps carefully.



### Step 1: Fork This Repository

Click the **"Fork"** button at the top-right corner of this page. This will create a complete copy of this repository under your personal GitHub account.

### Step 2: Create Your Branch

On **your forked repository**, create a new branch to hold your work. **Please name this branch after your team.**

You can do this locally on your computer after cloning your fork:

```bash

### Step 3: Add Your Project Files

Now it's time to build! Add all your project components to your branch:

1.  **Your Solution:** Add all your source code, folders, dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `package.json`), and any files needed to run your solution. You can use the `srcs/` folder or create your own structure.
2.  **Pitch presentation:** Add your final pitch (PDF or PPTX format) to the `pitch/` folder.

### Step 4: Commit & Push Your Work

As you work, commit your changes and push them to your fork on GitHub.
